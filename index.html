                <p>My name is Nolan Klinke and I am a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist with the National Strength and Conditioning Association as well as the Sr. Exercise Specialist at one of Plus One Health Management's premier fitness facilites in the Atlanta area. I hold a Master's Degree in Kinesiology from Augusta University.</p>
                <p>I decided to get into programming because I was intriqued with the process. The idea of building websites, apps, and basically anything with code fascinated me. I enjoy the problem solving and the satisfaction of finally figuring something out: that "AHA!" moment. </p>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech. After just finishing the first week of class when writing this, I very much look forward to where this program will take me and what is to come once I graduate from it.</p>
